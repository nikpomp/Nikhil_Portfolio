# 3D Solar System Portfolio

A visually immersive 3D portfolio website built with **Three.js**, representing my professional journey as a dynamic Solar System.

## 🌌 Core Concept
This project visualizes my life and skills as a universe:
-   **The Warp (Landing)**: Jumping into my universe.
-   **The Milky Way (Future)**: A view of my future goals and aspirations as distant star systems.
-   **The Solar System (Present)**: An interactive 3D model where planets represent my current skills, milestones, and projects.

## ✨ Features
-   **Interactive 3D World**: Navigate through space using Three.js.
-   **Living Environment**:
    -   **Procedural Sun**: A rotating, textured 3D sun.
    -   **Organic Orbits**: Planets drift and wobble naturally in elliptical paths.
    -   **Meteor Showers**: Periodic meteor bursts streak across the sky.
    -   **Shooting Stars**: Subtle background movement.
-   **Detailed Info Panels**: Click on any planet to reveal detailed cards about specific skills and achievements.
-   **Responsive UI**: enhanced with glassmorphism effects, sidebars, and smooth transitions.
